## How I manage my money (the little I have) :moneybag:

*April 17, 2020*

I’m a fan of personal finance. Growing up in a family where no one knew how to manage their money, I quickly learned that financially stability is important.

*Disclaimer: I'm full-time student, I have a part-time job at school, and do not have to pay for my college tuition/room/board. I don’t have bills to pay (besides my credit card bill & subscriptions). This may not be your financial situation. You may have more/less more to invest/save.*

Anyhow, here’s a breakdown of what I use:

### Cash and Savings

<a href="https://www.sofi.com/money/" target="_blank">SoFi Money</a> - “Checking Account that earns interest”

- In my opinion, the concept of a checking account and a savings account is outdated. SoFi  Money is a checking account that earns 0.2% interest (way higher than your average savings account)!
- SoFi Vaults - an extension of Sofi Money that allows you to allocate money to specific categories (e.g. emergency fund, saving for a car). It also earns to same 0.2% interest.  One of my vaults is a “savings account” and another is money I’ve set aside to move to Seattle.

### Investments

- <a href="https://www.sofi.com/invest/" target="_blank">SoFi Invest</a>
  - Active Investing - You can use this to buy fractional shares of company stocks/ETFs/crypto if you’re interested. I don’t really use this but I’ve purchased fractional shares for fun. 
  - Auto Investing - I have a recurring weekly deposit to this passive investing account. It automatically divides my investments into a diversified portfolio based on my risk level.
- <a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/" target="_blank">Wealthfront</a>
  - Auto Investing - This is my main passive investing account. It's almost exactly the same as SoFi’s Auto Investing (minus tax-harvesting benefits). I have a monthly deposit into the account.

## How I built this website :hammer:

Thanks to <a href="https://mattf1n.github.io" target="_blank">a boy who is my friend</a>, I learned about the world of classless CSS frameworks! I used <a href="https://mattf1n.github.io/posts.html" target="_blank">his site</a> to learn how to quickly create a system that allows me to write in markdown (I use <a href="https://typora.io/" target="_blank">Typora</a> as my markdown editor) and convert to html using <a href="https://pandoc.org/" target="_blank">pandoc</a>. The `makefile` is a game changer. 

I'm using <a href="https://watercss.netlify.app/#installation" target="_blank">Water.css</a> which I found under <a href="https://github.com/dbohdan/classless-css" target="_blank">a list</a> of classless css frameworks.
