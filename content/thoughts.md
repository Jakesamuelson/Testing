## Why atheists find religion absurd

May 14, 2020

If you were to ask me a year ago what I thought about organized religion, I would tell you “how could they possibly believe a God exists?” It seemed like the basis of religion was old anecdotes and special humans who had the ability to speak to God. From that, there came a collection of stories and rules that people today base their lives on. But aren’t we smart enough to realize that there is no evidence pointing to the fact that God is real and that these prophets probably had some type of mental disorder? I mean, hearing voices in your head sounds like a symptom of schizophrenia. 

This line of reasoning lacks imagination and is quite close-minded. In fact, these thoughts were my thoughts, warranted by my lack of experiences and knowledge of the world. The real question isn’t whether or not God exists; it’s why do millions, probably billions, of people believe in some god? Proof of a higher being doesn’t explain why hoards of people fall obedient to God. Millions of God-believing people aren’t crazy. We atheists are asking the wrong questions. 

## Why Believe?

So why? Why believe Jesus Christ is our savior? Why believe in Nirvana and reincarnation? Why kneel down and pray five times a day? These religions are remarkably similar. Their practices, or “rules” differ in detail, but their purposes are the same. How can we live a great life? These religions teach honesty, charity, hope, faith, obedience, and sacrifice. They show you how to respect your spouse and love your children. They tell you to love all. They give us a foundation on how to measure our lives and how to live a happy life. Life is much easier with some guidance.
